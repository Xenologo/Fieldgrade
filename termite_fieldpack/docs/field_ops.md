# Termite Field Ops

This fieldpack is an offline-first toolchain that can:

- ingest documents into CAS + SQLite + FTS
- emit hash-chained provenance
- seal deterministic signed bundles
- verify bundles against MEAP + tool allowlist
- replay bundles without tool re-execution

See `./bin/termite --help`.
